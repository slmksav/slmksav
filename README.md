### Hey there, looks like you've stumbled upon my GitHub page. ![penguin-walking](https://github.com/slmksav/slmksav/assets/87731856/078474b9-2114-468d-95c4-6787ce313373)

My name is **Sauli**, though I go by different nicknames on the internet as I try to not get too attached to one. I am **a freelance programmer and a software engineering student.** 

### About me 👤
I am an extremely versatile programmer and a dedicated hardware /  enthusiast. I develop anything from small microcontroller-powered devices to complex web applications. I have been **programming since about the age of 12**, starting with adding new items to Minecraft using Java with no additional modding tools. Ever since then I chose to entertain myself by building virtual worlds that often required building pieces of software or extensive scripting to achieve. Doing this at my best learning age, it grew a programmer out of me. 👨‍💻‍

📝 As of writing, I am **pursuing my Bachelor's in software engineering, specializing in embedded systems**


📍 I am currently residing in the EU
