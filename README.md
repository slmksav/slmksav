### Hey there, looks like you've stumbled upon my GitHub page. ![penguin-walking](https://github.com/slmksav/slmksav/assets/87731856/078474b9-2114-468d-95c4-6787ce313373)

My name is **Sauli**, though I go by different nicknames on the internet as I try to not get too attached to one. I am **a freelance programmer and a software engineer.**

### About me üë§
I am an extremely **versatile and passionate application builder and a dedicated hardware /  enthusiast**. I develop anything from small microcontroller-powered devices to complex web applications. In addition to these, I have been delving and diving deep into blockchain and web3 technology. 

üìç I am currently residing in the EU

üí¨ Always looking to chat with like-minded people or collaborate on projects :)

üíº For business proposals, shoot me a message on my website or one of my accounts

If you're interested, **check out that nice table detailing my projects and development experience** that I've prepared for you. ‚ÜôÔ∏è
