### Hey there, looks like you've stumbled upon my GitHub page. ![penguin-walking](https://github.com/slmksav/slmksav/assets/87731856/078474b9-2114-468d-95c4-6787ce313373)

I am a **Senior-level Developer and DevOps Engineer** with specialization in embedded systems and electronics with close to 2+7 (2 as a professional and 7 as a hobbyist) years of experience designing and implementing software that is not made for just the sake of having something done, but to achieve legitimate value derived from the solution.

I have developed anything from small microcontroller-powered devices to complex web applications as a full-stack developer. In addition to these, I have been working with Blockchain and Web3 technology and it's applications in IoT. In addition to these, I have been diving deep into Blockchain and Web3 technology, in an ever-increasing amount.

üìç I am currently residing in the EU and am studying towards an M.D. in Embedded Systems or related field.

I currently hold the **Head of Development** position in a Web3-oriented developmental agency based in the UAE in addition to running my own registered businesses.

And if you're interested, **check out the table below detailing my projects and development experience** that I've prepared for you. ‚ÜôÔ∏è
